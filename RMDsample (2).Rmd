## R markdown

+ include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
+ echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
+ message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
+ warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

In the book [@berlekamp2003winning] we study game theory. In [@doi:10.1002/jgt.22573] we study graphs
